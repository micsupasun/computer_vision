# computer vision

This GitHub page works on Computer Vision.

I have completed more than ten projects related to Computer Vision. In addition, I am studying Computer Vision(80 percent) and Natural Language Processing(20 percent) field at The University of Reading.

# Project
1. [assistant_blind](https://github.com/micsupasun/computer_vision/tree/main/assistant_blind) will help the visually impaired to carry out their daily activities without relying so much on others, enabling a more independent life for them. By implementing a federated learning approach, the distributed system of the edge computing devices will reduce the dependency on heavy computing systems required. Our research also aimed to reduce the latency as it is close to the speed of the network. This can be further enhanced by deploying the model to a larger scale which will help to collect more training data and improve the accuracy of the model which is on the cloud.
2. [face_recognition](https://github.com/micsupasun/computer_vision/tree/main/face_recognition) is to use a webcam to capture real-time video feed and recognize pre-defined faces within the video frames. The project compares faces detected in the video with a set of known faces that have been pre-loaded into the system, and it labels the recognized faces accordingly.
3. [object_detection_traffic_light_detection](https://github.com/micsupasun/computer_vision/tree/main/object_detection_traffic_light_detection) is to be able to distinguish objects and traffic light colors. This project can distinguish different objects in the video.
4. [product_recommendation](https://github.com/micsupasun/computer_vision/tree/main/product_recommendation) is to create a fashion recommendation system using ResNET that provides personalized fashion recommendations to users based on images they upload.
5. [virtual_keyboard](https://github.com/micsupasun/computer_vision/tree/main/virtual_keyboard) is a short script that performs a specific function or task. Please specify the details of the code, including what it does, how it works, and any necessary setup or dependencies required to run the code.
6. [volume_control](https://github.com/micsupasun/computer_vision/tree/main/volume_control) uses the OpenCV and mediapipe libraries to detect hands in video frames captured by a webcam. The script defines a handDetector class that provides an interface to the mediapipe library.
