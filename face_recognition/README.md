# Face Recognition

# Objective
The main goal of this project is to use a webcam to capture real-time video feeds and recognize pre-defined faces within the video frames. The project compares faces detected in the video with a set of known faces that have been pre-loaded into the system, and it labels the recognized faces accordingly.

# Step of work
1. Libraries and Webcam Initialization.
2. Loading Known Faces.
3. Storing Known Faces.
4. Real-Time Face Detection and Recognition.
5. Face Matching.
6. Displaying Results.
7. Exiting the Program.

# Result
1. The face recognition is performed by comparing face encodings. These encodings are generated using machine learning models that extract unique facial features from the images.

2. The project is limited to recognizing faces that have been pre-loaded into the system. Any face not included in the known faces will be labeled as "Unknown."

3. The project could be extended by adding more known faces or integrating additional features, such as storing recognized faces in a database or triggering actions based on recognition.
